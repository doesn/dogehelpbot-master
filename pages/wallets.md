Wallets are where dogecoins are stored. Wallets can be online or offline, although offline ones are seen as more secure and less vunerable to attack.

The two main wallets for Windows are Dogecoin-QT and MultiDoge. Most users will use Dogecoin-QT as it is arguably more powerful, and crucially helps to maintain the dogecoin network by verifying other transactions. Multidoge however leaves a much smaller resource footprint on your PC and is a fair choice for beginners.

You can get a Dogecoin Wallet app for android, and a Wallet viewer app for iOS, though this does not allow you to send doge.

When you set up a dogetipbot account it creates a wallet for you. You should not however keep large amounts of doge here as online wallets are vunerable to attack. *-> dogetipbot*
