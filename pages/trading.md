Trading is a great way to help strengthen the dogecoin economy and get some awesome stuff. There are two types of trading, trading Doge for other currencies (sometimes other cryptos, or often fiat - normal money), and trading doge for products or services.

This is a list of the best places to trade doge for products:

* /r/dogemarket - For buying doge, or other things like steam games

* http://suchlist.com - Like craigslist, but for dogecoin, suchlist is a great place to get things for doge.


You can often get large discounts on fiat prices for products such as steam games. Be warned though, scamming is something you will have to deal with. Take precautions such as checking reviews and a user's history before trading, and insisting that they go first.

Exchanges are places where you can buy doge for real money or other cryptocurrencies (often bitcoin). For a list of these, run the dogehelpbot command:
