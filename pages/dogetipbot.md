Tipping is a way for dogecoin users to give a gift of dogecoins to other users. These are usually in small amounts, but some generous shibes such as the legendary silentShibe reguarly tip up to 1000 doge.

dogetipbot is a bot that allows reddit users to send and receive dogecoins in the form of "tips." The bot operates on reddit when a user "summons" via a username mention to tip another user. The user instructs the bot to send a specific amount to another user, often as a reward for an exceptional comment or post.

When you get your first tip to dogetipbot, you will need to send a PM to /u/dogetipbot saying +accept in the message body to set up your dogetipbot account. From here you can give and recieve tips.

Sending a message saying +history in the message body shows your balance, transaction history, and dogetipbot wallet adress if you need to top up your tip account.

It is recommended that you only keep a small amount of doge in your tipbot account as it is vunerable to attack. The command '+withdraw ADRESS AMOUNT doge' is useful to move funds to an offline wallet (*-> Wallets*)
