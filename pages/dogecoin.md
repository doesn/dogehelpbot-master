Dogecoin is a crypto-currency, created in December 2013. It features a Shiba Inu from the internet meme 'Doge' as its mascot, and is commonly used to 'tip' other users small amounts of coin as a thanks.

The community is at the centre of Dogecoin, and the /r/Dogecoin subreddit is always a lively and enjoyable place. Charity and giving are also very important to dogecoin, and its users have donated to give clean drinking water to those in need and to bring the Jamaican bobsleigh team to the Sochi Winter Olympics.

Dogecoin users also sponsored Josh Wise's #98 NASCAR to compete at the Talledega speedway with full Dogecoin Livery.

Users of Dogecoin often keep alive the spirit of the original meme, using its trademark broken english and bad spelling in their comments. The term 'To the Moon' is used to describe the coin's rising value.
